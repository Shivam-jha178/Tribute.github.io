<h2>Importnat things about albert einstine</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Albert einstine was widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time.</li>
    <li>Einstein is known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.</li>
    <li> His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.</li>
    <li>He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"</li>
    <li>In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers</li>
    <li>These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence.</li>
    <li>He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916</li>
    <li>He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.</li>
    <li>In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power. Einstein did not return to Germany because he objected to the policies of the newly elected Nazi-led government.[</li>
    <li> He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.[17] On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies, but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons.</li>
